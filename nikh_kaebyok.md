## NIKH History Textbook Corpus

The National Institute of Korean History (NIKH) history textbook corpus brings together Korean history textbooks produced under successive national curricula, spanning from the late Joseon and Korean Empire through the Japanese colonial period, liberation, and the postwar national curricula up to the present.

You may peruse an online-navigable version of the history textbooks through the National Institute of Korean History's official website: [contents.history.go.kr](https://contents.history.go.kr/front/ta/main.do)

Because textbooks are central to the formation of collective memory and national identity, this corpus is well suited for exploring questions of modern Korean identity, historical narrative construction, and changing representations of key events and figures across different political eras.

## Kaebyok Magazine (1920–1935)

The Kaebyok corpus contains full-text articles from an interwar Korean magazine reflecting cultural, intellectual, and political debates during the Japanese colonial period. The magazine served as a forum for discussions of nationalism, modernization, literature, and social reform, making it a valuable resource for studying colonial-era Korean intellectual history.
