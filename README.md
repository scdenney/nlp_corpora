# NLP Corpora for Korean Studies

A curated collection of text corpora for digital humanities and computational social science research on Korea. These datasets support students, researchers, and instructors at the Leiden Institute for Area Studies and beyond who are interested in applying computational methods to Korean-language primary sources.

This repository is maintained by **Steven Denney** (Leiden University). Additional corpora will be added over time.
