# Research Corpora

This folder contains six curated datasets for text analysis and computational social science research. Each dataset consists of:

- **A CSV file** — the corpus data
- **A Markdown (.md) file** — documentation with variable definitions, context, and suggested uses

The folders containing interview responses also include reference articles. **Read the `.md` file first** before working with any dataset.
